`codeblock.png` comes from the `codesnippet` plugin bundled with CKEditor.

TODOs:

 * Provide a way to remove a codeblock application
 * Provide a way to do handle *inline* code segments
 * Highlight code snippets within the editor
 * Provide a UI for manually the language of the code.
   This could be similar to an inline UI for links -- in-context popup.
   No dialogs, please!
 * If the code block is the first block in the editor,
   you must edit the source to insert a paragraph before it.
   Pressing enter at the beginning of the codeblock should do that.
