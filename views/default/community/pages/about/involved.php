<p class="leader">Elgg is continually being developed and enhanced by an active and growing community of organizations, developers and enthusiasts world wide. There are lots of ways to get involved, whether you're a developer contributing plugins, a designer contributing themes, or a user who just wants to spread the word.  We also welcome contributions from bug-fixers through to those generous enough to help new users get started.</p>
<p class="leader">The Elgg <a href="activity" class="accent_color">community pages</a> are a great place to start.</p>
