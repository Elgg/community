<p>The domain policy establishes who can use Elgg in top level domain names and
	exists to identify the official Elgg sites, to protect Elgg users, and to protect Elgg
	as a project.</p>

<p>The only domains permitted to use "elgg" in the name are elgg.org, theelggfoundation.org,
	and elgg.com. These are the official sites and are operated by the Elgg Foundation or
	Thematic Networks. Any other sites using “elgg” in a top level domain is in violation
	of this policy and the Elgg trademark.</p>

<p>Special exceptions can be requested for sites dedicated to Elgg conferences. Elgg
	conferences, usually called “Elgg Camps,” serve to further Elgg as a project, are
	operated without generating revenue, and do not use Elgg in a commercial capacity. If
	you plan to organize an Elgg Camp and want to create a domain for it, please contact the
	Elgg Foundation at info@elgg.org to request a domain exception. You should not
	purchase a domain until you receive notification that your exception request has been
	approved.</p>

<p>The domain policy does not apply to subdomains. For example, you may create the
	subdomain “elgg.mysite.org” and still satisfy the requirements of this policy.</p>

<p>If your site is in violation of this policy, you should redirect to a subdomain or a
	new domain. We are happy to assist anyone who is planning to migrate their site from a
	violating domain, so please contact us if you need help.</p>

<p>Violators of this policy will not be permitted to have an account on
	elgg.org or to advertise services on elgg.org.</p>
